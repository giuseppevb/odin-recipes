    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pepperoni pizza recipe produces a quick and easy 
        classic! Delicious homemade pizza crust and tomato sauce have never been easier.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Fleischmann's Easy Pizza Crust</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise Yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL Pepperoni</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</li>
            <li>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm 
                water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, 
                a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. 
                Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto 
            the prepared pizza pans.</li>
            <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. 
                Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
        </ol>
